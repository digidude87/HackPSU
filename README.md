Voice.com -> Project created at HackPSU

Credits : https://github.com/mtschirs/js-objectdetect for image detection

Voice.com is a website developed with a vision to aid students with visual disability or dyslexia in their studies by providing a portal which provides text to speech conversion through VoiceRSS API.

Also for the visually impaired, the controls to Pause/Play video are defined by hand gestures using js-objectdetect.

The project currently supports only text files/plain text for text input.

Hosted at https://voiceassist.herokuapp.com/   (not working as expected due to some issue with file uploads which is induced when a project is deployed through war on heroku. Working fine on localhost and will demo through localhost)
